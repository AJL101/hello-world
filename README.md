# hello-world
First GitHub project

Hello world! My name is AJ and I'm studying software development w/ java through the open university, but I have joined GitHub to help sharpen my coding skills as we have only been coding in a couple of the modules. I aspire to become a freelancer, but I know I've got a very long road ahead of me!
